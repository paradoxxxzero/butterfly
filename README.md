## Description

## Features

* Native browser scroll and search
* Theming in css / sass [(18 preset themes)](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/butterfly-themes) endless possibilities!
* HTML in your terminal! cat images and use &lt;table&gt;
* Multiple sessions support (à la screen -x) to simultaneously access a terminal from several places on the planet!
* Secure authentication with X509 certificates!
* 16,777,216 colors support!
* Keyboard text selection!
* Desktop notifications on terminal output!
* Geolocation from browser!
* May work on firefox too!

## Try it

```bash
    $ pip install butterfly
    $ pip install libsass  # If you want to use themes
    $ butterfly
```

A new tab should appear in your browser. Then type

```bash
    $ butterfly help
```

To get an overview of butterfly features.


## Run it as a server

```bash
    $ butterfly.server.py --host=myhost --port=57575
```

The first time it will ask you to generate the certificates (see: [here](http://paradoxxxzero.github.io/2014/03/21/butterfly-with-ssl-auth.html))


## Run it with systemd (linux)

Systemd provides a way to automatically activate daemons when needed (socket activation):

```bash
    $ cd /etc/systemd/system
    # curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paradoxxxzero/butterfly/master/butterfly.service
    # curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paradoxxxzero/butterfly/master/butterfly.socket
    # systemctl enable butterfly.socket
    # systemctl start butterfly.socket
```

Don't forget to update the /etc/butterfly/butterfly.conf file with your server options (host, port, shell, ...)
