## Description

Butterfly is a tornado web server written in python which powers a full featured web terminal.

The js part is heavily based on [term.js](https://github.com/chjj/term.js/) which is heavily based on [jslinux](http://bellard.org/jslinux/).


## Try it

```bash
    $ pip install butterfly
    $ butterfly.server.py
```

Then open [localhost:57575](http://localhost:57575) in your favorite browser and done.


## Contribute

and make the world better (or just butterfly).

Don't hesitate to fork the repository and start hacking on it, I am very open to pull requests.

If you don't know what to do go to the github issues and pick one you like.

If you want to motivate me to continue working on this project you can tip me, see: http://paradoxxxzero.github.io/about/

The dev requirements are coffee script and compass for the client side.
Run `python dev.py --debug --port=12345` and you are set (yes you can launch it from your regular butterfly instance)
